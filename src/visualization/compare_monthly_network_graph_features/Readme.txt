Abstract features from network graphs and plot over time

- R markdown scripts for exploring Comtrade data
- Data can be accessed via SQL request ? see get_Comtrade_data_network_graph.R
- Script can be edited to explore other commodes and countries
- Use to get an idea of how network features (eigen centrality, edge density, transitivity, sum degree and average path length change over time)
- Can adapt script to explore other network features ? see Tidygraph package for more options
